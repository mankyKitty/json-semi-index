# JSON Semi-Index Implementation

A few implementations of the 'semi-indexer' described in [this paper](http://www.di.unipi.it/~ottavian/files/semi_index_cikm.pdf).

Run the `dev.sh` to use `ghcid` to mess around with the implementation and see
how it affects the index. The primary purpose of this was to be able to retrieve
the closing character of a Array or Object to confirm that it was closed with
the correct character.
